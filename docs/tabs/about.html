            <p style="text-align: justify;"> So... Where does this passion for robotics come from? <br>
                I started developing my enthusiasm for robots and crazy inventions in my early years, building a first
                robotic friend when I was <b class="b-bold">6 years old</b class="b-bold">! <br>
                A few years later, I became interested in radio-controlled cars, then came RC planes, and finally <b
                    class="b-bold"> racing drones </b class="b-bold">
                in 2016. This wonderful hobby helped me develop my <b class="b-bold"> technical and problem-solving
                    skills </b class="b-bold"> in real life in
                a completely new way. Participating and organizing events even helped me to develop my <b
                    class="b-bold">team-work,
                    communication, and leadership abilities. </b class="b-bold"><br>
                During this time at university, I became eager to deepen my understanding on <b
                    class="b-bold">autonomous systems</b class="b-bold">,
                enhanced by a master course on self-driving cars I took during my semester abroad at <b
                    class="b-bold">University of
                    Michigan </b class="b-bold">. My journey at university finished with excellent results, but my
                knowledge on modern robotics was still
                not enough for me. I happily applied to <b class="b-bold">MSc. Robotics</b class="b-bold"> programs and
                got selected to the double
                (Poland-Japan) master degree on robotics of the JEMARO program (5% acceptance rate). I couldn't let go
                this opportunity. <br>
                I am currently working on my MSc. thesis on visual <b class="b-bold">3D map building</b class="b-bold">
                for task planning. Other topics I am
                working on are a <b class="b-bold">visual odometry</b class="b-bold"> frontend for SLAM, and a <b
                    class="b-bold">real-time cloud image segmentation</b class="b-bold"> pipeline
                for AVs. Moreover I am working hands-on with the Nvidia Jetson Nano, ROS and Gazebo simulations. Can't
                stop
                learning! <br>
                My curiosity and proactivity has also led me to learn some <b class="b-bold">business</b class="b-bold">
                including basic marketing, sales,
                finances and product management, with which I started developing my own mobile app to help restaurants,
                and improve my programming skills!<br>
                I am looking forward to start my journey in the industry to continue shaping the <b
                    class="b-bold">future of society</b class="b-bold">.
                Autonomous vehicles, robots and computer intelligence will continue improving our daily lifes, and I
                <b class="b-bold">MUST </b> be part of that change!
