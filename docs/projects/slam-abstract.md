This project is our solution for the HILTI SLAM Challenge 2022. It merges two
popular simultaneous localization and mapping approaches to benefit from the
high precision of a LIDAR sensor
([A-LOAM](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/A-LOAM)) and the high
frequency measurements of a camera
([ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)) by fusing the results with a
Kalman Filter.
