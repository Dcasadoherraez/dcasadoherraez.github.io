The Extended Kalman Filter was one of the first approaches of SLAM by
performing a local linearization of a nonlinear system. It couples the
current state of the robot only to the previous state and estimates is
probability of being at the current state. 

This simulation has two goals, to perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) of a robot in a 2D world with odometry and range-sensor readings, and to compare its performance using concurrent programming techniques.

The problem formulation is based on Cyrill Stachniss lecture on robot
mapping [1] (University of Freiburg) as well as
'Simultaneous localization and mapping with the extended Kalman filter'
by Joan Sol√† [2]. The sensor data was generated by the same
professor. In addition, the robot odometry measurement is based
on the odometry motion model.
