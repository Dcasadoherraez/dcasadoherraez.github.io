5% of the world population has a fear of heights [1]. This fear, known as
Acrophobia, will last for at least 20-30% of their lives causing them intense
anxiety and stress when they face certain scenarios. Current solutions to this
problem are usually exposure based, where the patient is stimulated in different
scenarios. However this requires the patient to be present at a specific
location and the willingness to go there.

Another critical problem in the current world today is stroke, it is the number
1 cause of adult disability and lies among the top 10 causes of death globally.
From those who suffer it, 10% recover almost completely, 25% recover with minor
impairments, and 40% experience moderate impairments that require special care
[2] while the remaining 25% will suffer severe impairments or die. One of the
main disabilities related to motor skills is static and dynamic balance, as well
as gait ability. Treatments  involve attending the caregiving facilities for the
therapy. 

In addition, the use of virtual reality headsets is growing at incredible rates,
with a 75% increase from 2018 to 2022, meaning that the chances of owning one is
becoming more and more common. Studies have shown [4] how VR mobile apps can
effectively be used for acrophobia treatment. In addition, research has been put
into gait balancing in a treadmill [5] [6] demonstrating positive side effects
on the use of this technology. This makes it a convenient scenario to develop an
innovative mixed-reality app used for improving the condition of acrophobia
patients, as well as those in advanced stages of stroke recovery.
