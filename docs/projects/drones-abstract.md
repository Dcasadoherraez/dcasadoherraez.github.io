There's nothing better than going out there and fly! Yes, literally. Put on your First Person View (FPV) goggles and get up in the air with a machine you've built and configured yourself. Drone racing has been my hobby for almost 5 years and it has taught me on every aspect of life, ranging from technical skills to leadership and discipline. I will be visual in this section, expand it and check out some of my milestones!
